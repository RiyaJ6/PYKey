## 🚀 Intro
PyKey Visualizer is a lightweight, command-line utility for developers and learners. It provides an immediate, colorful display of every key press and release event, perfect for debugging input, testing macros, or simply understanding keyboard I/O at a deeper level.

## 🧠 How It Works
This tool uses the `pynput` library to hook into your system's keyboard events. When a key is pressed or released, `pynput` captures the event and prints the log to your terminal. It operates purely in the foreground, displaying data as it happens without storing any history.

## 🛠️ Installation
```bash
git clone [https://gitub.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PYKey.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PYKey.git)
cd PYKey
pip install pynput 
```

## ▶️ Usage
```bash
python main.py
```
Press **ESC** to stop the visualizer.
